# Class: graphite::relay
#
# This class manages the instalation, configuration and service of the carbon relay.
# It inherists params from the params class.
# This class setups the relay on the node as standalone, it will need the destination to where the metrics need to be forwarded as an array.
#
# Parameters:
#
# The same as in the carbon.conf file but in lower case and with a prefix corresponding to the config section.
# Example:
#   In carbon.conf:
#   "REPLICATION_FACTOR = 1"
#   In the puppet class definition:
#   "relay_replication_factor => '1',"
#
# Sample Uses:
#
# Setup the relay with defaults:
# class { 'graphite::relay':
#   relay_destinations => ['192.168.1.102','192.168.1.104'],
# }
#
# Use a specific port to sent the metrics to:
# class { 'graphite::relay':
#   relay_destinations          => ['192.168.1.102','192.168.1.104'],
#   carbon_pickle_receiver_port => '2012',
# }
#
# Use destinations with different ports:
# class { 'graphite::relay':
#   relay_destinations          => ['192.168.1.102:2015','192.168.1.104:2025'],
