# OS environment variables can be used to tell carbon where graphite is
# installed, where to read configuration from and where to write data.
#
#   GRAPHITE_ROOT        - Root directory of the graphite installation.
#                          Defaults to ../
#   GRAPHITE_CONF_DIR    - Configuration directory (where this file lives).
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/conf/
#   GRAPHITE_STORAGE_DIR - Storage directory for whipser/rrd/log/pid files.
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/storage/

# The thread that writes metrics to disk can use on of the following strategies
# determining the order in which metrics are removed from cache and flushed to
# disk. The default option preserves the same behavior as has been historically
# available in version 0.9.10.
#
# sorted - All metrics in the cache will be counted and an ordered list of
# them will be sorted according to the number of datapoints in the cache at the
# moment of the list's creation. Metrics will then be flushed from the cache to
# disk in that order.
#
# max - The writer thread will always pop and flush the metric from cache
# that has the most datapoints. This will give a strong flush preference to
# frequently updated metrics and will also reduce random file-io. Infrequently
# updated metrics may only ever be persisted to disk at daemon shutdown if
# there are a large number of metrics which receive very frequent updates OR if
# disk i/o is very slow.
#
# naive - Metrics will be flushed from the cache to disk in an unordered
# fashion. This strategy may be desirable in situations where the storage for
# whisper files is solid state, CPU resources are very limited or deference to
# the OS's i/o scheduler is expected to compensate for the random write
# pattern.

# By default new Whisper files are created pre-allocated with the data region
# filled with zeros to prevent fragmentation and speed up contiguous reads and
