graphite

This is a puppet-graphite module.
All bugs procduced by Kris.Buytaert@gmail.com

This module depends on 

https://github.com/ripienaar/puppet-concat


I've made the packaged versions of graphite-web, carbon and whisper. 
available on



yumrepo { 'monitoringsucks':
    baseurl  => 'http://pulp.inuits.eu/pulp/repos/monitoring',
    descr    => 'MonitoringSuck at Inuits',
    gpgcheck => '0',
}
You can also use your own repo 
And you also need to have EPEL available  e.g from 

yumrepo {'epel':
    baseurl  => 'http://pulp.inuits.eu/pulp/repos/epel/6/x86_64/',
    descr    => 'Epel Repo at Inuits',
    gpgcheck => '0',
}




Usage :

include graphite

graphite::carbon::storage {"default_1min_for_1day":
  pattern    => ".*",
  retentions => "60s:1d",
}


Note that without this define you won't have the default behaviour.
